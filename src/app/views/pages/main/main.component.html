    question="Why did you feel the need of a change in your career choices?"
    text="I've always admired Civil Engineering, and it was this area that allowed me to develop my logical thinking, in major grades such as Calculus and its five-hour tests. Despite of that, I realised that the innovation on civil engineering is quite slow and new methods aren't always encouraged. My goal in life is finding a perfect sync between logic, visual arts and constant innovation, and that seemed to be lacking on traditional Civil Engineering. I appreciate all the knowledge that engineering has given me,
     but my future is in web development">

  <ana-accordion
    question="What makes you different?"
    text="Since I was a teenager,
     I found myself loving to work on
      visual projects and using tools like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. And I couldn't help but thinking I should head that way. Although, my flair with numbers and a family of civil engineers influenced me to opt in the same path. Today, I see that the visual area, that has always been my passion, can integrate on engineering logic and it gives
     me a keener perspective of everything.">

  <ana-accordion
    question="Hobbies?"
    text="I love painting (you're more than welcome to see a little more here).
    And I'm very into reading and understanding more about art history.
    Also, I am currently
    studying a third language which is Deutsch. (Bitte!)">
